"""This module includes the base classes for logging handlers and related objects.

A logging handler enables easy and convenient Python idiomatic structured
logging. Once configured, it can help collect runtime information
(such as current stack frame, current time, and current module) and
request specific contexts (such as current user, and the source of the
request) and send them, along with custom messages, to a
source (standard streams, Fluentd, Logstash, Stackdriver, etc.) in the form
of structured payloads automatically. You can also add logging handlers
to an endpoint in a microservice/API service so that it can automatically
log the beginning and the end of the processing of a request.

    A log context is a `Model` (see `model.py`) that specifies a number of
    request specific attributes that logging handlers can access and add
    to log entries.

    For example, the frontend of an e-commerce system often adds the IDs of
    customers to requests, which the backend can use to tag the logs. With
    these tags, developers may group log entries by customers, making it
    easy to track customer activities.

    A log context extractor extracts a log context from a request. For example,

    can use.

        mode is only available when you use logging handlers in an asynchronous
        transport (e.g. quart).
    
    To-Do: These modes have not been implemented in logging handlers. The
    default logging handler (`LoggingHandler`), LogStash logging Handler, and
