"""This module includes the base class nanopie uses for handling requests and
a subclass of it that performs simple, function-based handling.

nanopie uses `Handler` instances to process requests and prepare responses
in a microservice/API service. Each handler performs a specific task, such
as authentication, logging, tracing, and serialization/deserialization.
Handlers can be chained together, which allows a handler to do its job,
pass the baton to another handler, and wrap everything up when the chained
handler(s) finishes processing.
